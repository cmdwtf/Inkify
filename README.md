# ‚úíüåà Inkify
A .NET 5.0 command line tool to reduce image colors, dither them, and size them to fit nicely on [Pimoroni eInk Displays](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/pimoroni?filter=e-ink+Displays)

## Project State
It's rough and fresh out of my brain. Build and runs on Windows & macOS. I haven't tested it yet, but I intend to run this on a Raspberry Pi, but just haven't got to that point yet. There's probably plenty that doesn't work right, so feel free to open an issue or PR if you find something.

## üí° Inspiration
For more about what inspired this, check out [this post](https://github.com/pimoroni/inky/issues/126) over on pimoroni/inky!

## Image Output Format
Right now, images are output at PNGs. However, they're not being created as 8bpp indexed pngs. (There is code to generate the images in that format, but `System.Drawing.Bitmap` seems to always write them as 32 bit PNGs for now.

## Usage
Build it up, then invoke it from the command line. You can use the option `--help` to see the built in help, but a general use would look something like these:

```shell
$ # General help and command argument/option info
$ dotnet Inkify.dll --help

$ # Transform test.jpg using implied options:
$ # Inky Impression display,
$ # Stucki dithering algorithm,
$ # Saturated color palette
$ dotnet Inkify.dll transform "test.jpg"

$ # List available dithering algorithms (pass them to -e)
$ dotnet Inkify.dll ditherers

$ # Transform test.jpg with all available dithering algorithms,
$ # using the implicitly implied Inky Impression display as the target,
$ # with a color saturation percent of 0.7.
$ # (Will produce one output file per dithering algorithm)
$ dotnet Inkify.dll transform "test.jpg" -e All -s 0.7

$ # Transform test.jpg using the Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm,
$ # targeting the Inky pHat with the Black/White/Yellow display.
$ dotnet Inkify.dll transform "test.jpg" -d PhatYellow -e FloydSteinbergDithering
```

## üåÑ Screenshots
Certainly not entirely representitive, but if you just want to take a peek at the kinds of images Inkify can spit out, here you go:
